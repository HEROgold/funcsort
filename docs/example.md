# Example

## Before

```python
class Example:
    def _protected_instance(self):
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def public_static():
        pass

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    @classmethod
    def _protected_class(cls):
        pass

    def public_instance(self):
        pass

    def __private_method(self):
        pass

    @classmethod
    def public_class(cls):
        pass
```

## After (with the default config)

```python
class Example:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def public_instance(self):
        pass

    @classmethod
    def public_class(cls):
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def public_static():
        pass

    def _protected_instance(self):
        pass

    @classmethod
    def _protected_class(cls):
        pass

    def __private_method(self):
        pass
```

The methods are now organised by:

1. **Visibility**: creational (`__init__`) → dunder → public → protected → private
2. **Type** (within each visibility): instance → class → static

See [Sorting behaviour](sorting-behaviour.md) for the rules behind this ordering.
